### 1. Trying the same commit again

If you commit too early, forget to add some files or mess up your commit message. If you want to try that commit again, you can run commit `git commit --amend` 


### 2. Unstaging an Accidentally Staged file

If you accidentally stage two files using `git add *` or `git add xyz.d abc.md`, you can unstage one file by simply using the command 'git reset HEAD filename.ext`.
